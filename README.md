# React + Vite Project Setup Guide

This README file provides a step-by-step guide to set up and run a React project using Vite.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (package managers)

To check if you have them installed, run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Installation Steps

### 1. Create a New Project

Use the following command to create a new React project with Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

Replace `my-react-app` with your desired project name.

If you prefer using Yarn, use:

```bash
yarn create vite my-react-app --template react
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the newly created project folder:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

For Yarn, use:

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the server and provide a local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

---

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

For Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist` directory.

---

## Previewing the Production Build

To locally preview the production build, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will start a server to preview your production build locally.
